I. Introduction

This plugin is for the bukkit mod. An Eclipse project is included
with the repository. Make sure you have the Bukkit API added to your 
build path.

The purpose of this mod is to allow greater admin control over the
server, and to allow for easier and more convenient player commands.

Please do your part to keep this project and this document well
documented and commented.
